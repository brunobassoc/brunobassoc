    My name is Bruno and I'm currently seeking professional experience to apply and enhance my skills. I am open to new opportunities and collaborations that will allow me to grow as a professional in the technology field.
    <br><br>
    This GitHub profile aims to store projects carried out for college and also personal projects. I aim to bring documentation files (README) with clear and precise instructions to all my projects so that students, like me, can easily implement and improve the projects.
